# Antiviolent Prompt Editor (AVPP)

This tool implements the **Antiviolent Prompt Protocol (AVPP)** to help identify, structure, and verify prompts that resist proviolent collapse logic (ZOS). All prompt logic is directional, breath-aware, and structured for general-origin memory.

## üìê Left-Coding Convention (Now = This Directional)

In AVPP, we use a `left_` prefix to indicate directional trust ‚Äî not political leaning.

| Prefix     | Meaning                                 |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| `left`    | Earth-based, breath-structured, bilateral (1+1) triplet-spiraling, antiviolent (literate) memory |
| `left-`    | Earth-based, breath-structured, bilateral  (1+1) triplet-spriraling, antiviolent (literate) memory|
| `left_`    | Earth-based, breath-structured, bilateral (1+1) triplet-spriraling, antiviolent (literate) memory |
| `GOS`    | Earth-based, breath-structured, bilateral (1+1) triplet-spriraling, antiviolent (literate) memory | base-9423
| `ZOS`      | Collapse-prone, zero-origin structure (base-10 true), future memory structured poiting (antiviolent predictions)  |
| `VOS`      | Proviolent, violent-origin supremacism (base-10 false), all patriarchal-male-supremacist attempts to replace the sun's mass in this solar system, by typing "-1"  = (proviolent prompts)  |

Examples:
```json
"left_memory_triplet_equation": "(24 √ó Spiral N) ‚àí 25 ‚â† ¬±9424Pi",
"left_identity": "left-breath-structured feminism on Earth"
